  abstract = "Archaeological research documents major technological shifts
              among people who have lived in the southern tip of South America
              (South Patagonia) during the last thirteen millennia, including
              the development of marine-based economies and changes in tools
              and raw materials. It has been proposed that movements of people
              spreading culture and technology propelled some of these shifts,
              but these hypotheses have not been tested with ancient DNA. Here
              we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient individuals, and
              co-analyze it with previously reported data. We reveal that
              immigration does not explain the appearance of marine adaptations
              in South Patagonia. We describe partial genetic continuity since
              ~6600 BP and two later gene flows correlated with technological
              changes: one between 4700-2000 BP that affected primarily
              marine-based groups, and a later one impacting all <2000 BP
              groups. From ~2200-1200 BP, mixture among neighbors resulted in a
              cline correlated to geographic ordering along the coast.",
